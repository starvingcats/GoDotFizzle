# GoDotFizzle - Better name to be found

A game inspired by "Overcooked" and "Moving out".

You play as a factory worker, your tasks is to assemble different items on a conveyor belt running through the level.
Assembling can be very simple , e.g. awooden chest, or very complex, e.g. a car.
The time to assemble stuff is limited by the speed of the conveyor belt, recipes require a different amount of steps to be assembled.
